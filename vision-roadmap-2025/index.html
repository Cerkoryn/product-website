scalable foundation for a decentralized global economy. This will
be achieved by significantly enhancing L1 performance through
the Leios protocol and optimizing the current codebase, while
simultaneously expanding the capabilities of L2 solutions
like Hydra and Midgard. By improving developer experience
through enhanced APIs, robust tooling, and a focus on
decentralization, Cardano aims to empower developers to
build innovative and impactful applications. Furthermore,
the expansion of programmable assets, including advanced
features like account abstraction and custodian regulated
stablecoins, will unlock new possibilities for decentralized
finance and beyond. This vision emphasizes a strong commitment
to research, community collaboration, and the long-term
sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.</p><p>The general themes of the community&#x27;s short-term vision, as
analyzed through the community roadmap survey, focus on
increasing scalability, interoperability, and usability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="#roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap">​</a></h2><p>The 2025 roadmap comprises a number of items that have been
proposed by community members, as described below.
It is expected that progress will be made on most or all
of this roadmap. Importantly, the scope of the roadmap is not
fixed, but is open to new community contributions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scaling-the-l1-engine">Scaling the L1 Engine<a href="#scaling-the-l1-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaling the L1 Engine" title="Direct link to Scaling the L1 Engine">​</a></h3><p>L1 performance is crucial for widespread adoption and
enabling Cardano to become a central hub for blockchain
communication. This will be achieved through a combination
of codebase optimization and architectural enhancements
to increase parallelization.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="leios">Leios<a href="#leios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leios" title="Direct link to Leios">​</a></h4><p>Leios is a groundbreaking innovation designed to
significantly enhance Cardano&#x27;s scalability and
transaction throughput. It introduces a novel approach
to block creation, moving away from the traditional
sequential model.</p><ul><li>Leios leverages a parallel block
creation process. Instead of a single linear chain
of blocks, it introduces multiple &quot;input blocks&quot;
that are independently created and endorsed by
Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). These endorsements
are then aggregated into &quot;endorsement blocks,&quot;
and finally, a &quot;ranking block&quot; determines the final
order and validity of transactions across all input
blocks.</li><li>This parallel approach has the
potential to dramatically increase transaction
throughput while maintaining the security and
decentralization of the Cardano blockchain.</li></ul><p>The roadmap for 2025 includes several key steps to achieve
in preparation for the development and implementation of Leios:</p><ul><li>Develop formal specifications to guide node
implementations and ensure correctness.</li><li>Conduct extensive simulations to validate
the theoretical design of Leios in real-world
network conditions and identify optimal parameters.</li><li>Refactor the Cardano node to facilitate
the integration of Leios and ensure smooth
and efficient operation.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimizations">Optimizations<a href="#optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimizations" title="Direct link to Optimizations">​</a></h4><ul><li><p>Optimize the current codebase and address technical debt to
improve performance. This will enable more flexible parameter
adjustments by the parameter committee, allowing for increased
scalability without requiring a hard fork.</p></li><li><p>Enhance Mithril&#x27;s decentralization by integrating
it more closely with the node and utilizing
existing networking layers.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anti-grinding">Anti-grinding<a href="#anti-grinding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anti-grinding" title="Direct link to Anti-grinding">​</a></h4><ul><li>Introduce measures to mitigate CPU-based grinding
attacks, improving settlement speed and network security.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lsm-integration">LSM Integration<a href="#lsm-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LSM Integration" title="Direct link to LSM Integration">​</a></h4><ul><li>Reduce memory requirements for nodes by integrating
Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees, initially
focusing on the UTxO set.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="incoming-liquidity">Incoming Liquidity<a href="#incoming-liquidity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incoming Liquidity" title="Direct link to Incoming Liquidity">​</a></h3><p>Increasing liquidity from other ecosystems is vital
for expanding Cardano&#x27;s user base.</p><ul><li>Utilize zero-knowledge proofs to enable Cardano
to serve as a decentralized DeFi layer for Bitcoin.</li><li>Babel Fees (Nested Transactions) facilitate
transactions on the L1 for users without initial
ADA holdings through a decentralized marketplace
that allows partial transactions to be accepted
and combined from multiple parties, where a
marketplace can arbitrage the value in ADA for a
user to get ADA to spend the transaction and
have the minimum ADA required without having
to purchase ADA first through an exchange.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="l2-expansion">L2 Expansion<a href="#l2-expansion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to L2 Expansion" title="Direct link to L2 Expansion">​</a></h3><p>To accommodate increasing transaction volume,
Cardano will focus on expanding the capabilities
of L2 solutions.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cardano-as-a-partner-chain">Cardano as a Partner Chain<a href="#cardano-as-a-partner-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cardano as a Partner Chain" title="Direct link to Cardano as a Partner Chain">​</a></h4><p>Enable the creation of independent chains with
customizable parameters, leveraging Cardano&#x27;s
security while offering greater flexibility.</p><p>By adding weighted BFT and/or FastBFT consensus mechanisms
to ouroboros-consensus and creating a slimmed down single
era ledger, the existing cardano code base can be used
to create partner chains. This can also be used as an
example for node implementations in other languages
to create partner chains.</p><p>After a proof of concept is completed, future partner chains
using the code base can be used to add new functionality
such as chimeric ledgers, new VMs, such as an EVM layer,
or new consensus improvements such as ouroboros-chronos
to be prototyped and tested quickly without affecting
the mainnet Cardano roadmap.</p><p>This also opens the door when minotaur release is completed
to use multiple consensus sources to generate the leadership
schedule in the future.</p><p>It can be envisioned that multiple dApps may want to launch
a partner chain together with more aggressive parameters
and lower fees to better serve their users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="partner-chain-bridges">Partner Chain Bridges<a href="#partner-chain-bridges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Partner Chain Bridges" title="Direct link to Partner Chain Bridges">​</a></h4><p>Develop a decentralized open standard for seamless
value transfer between partner chains.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hydra">Hydra<a href="#hydra" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hydra" title="Direct link to Hydra">​</a></h4><p>Explore new use cases for Hydra, such as governance
tools, and continue to enhance its scalability
and performance.</p><ul><li><p>Build upon the success of Hydra Doom by identifying
and developing further use cases that can leverage
Hydra&#x27;s scalability to benefit the Cardano ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Explore the use of Hydra as a platform for decentralized
governance discussions and voting, addressing
the challenges of managing large volumes of
information on the L1.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="midgard">Midgard<a href="#midgard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Midgard" title="Direct link to Midgard">​</a></h4><p>Midgard is Cardano’s first optimistic rollup framework,
leveraging the EUTxO model to achieve permissionless
operation, efficient fraud proofs, and censorship
resistance, without relying on centralized sequencers
or custodial multisigs. This unique design enables
high-throughput, low-fee transactions while maintaining
Cardano&#x27;s robust security and decentralization.
By aggregating off-chain transactions into compact
representations on-chain, Midgard ensures that
increased activity directly benefits Cardano’s L1,
enabling a sustainable and innovative ecosystem
for decentralized applications.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="finality-peras">Finality (Peras)<a href="#finality-peras" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Finality (Peras)" title="Direct link to Finality (Peras)">​</a></h4><p>Peras is an enhancement to the Ouroboros Praos protocol that aims
to accelerate transaction settlement times. In the current Praos protocol,
new blocks are added probabilistically, and the longest chain of blocks is
generally considered the valid one. Peras introduces a novel approach
by incorporating a voting mechanism among Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).</p><p>SPOs can vote to endorse specific blocks, effectively increasing their weight
within the chain. This &quot;voting&quot; mechanism allows for a faster consensus on the
most valid chain, leading to quicker transaction finality. Faster transaction
finality can significantly improve the user experience and enable
more efficient and timely transactions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developeruser-experience">Developer/User Experience<a href="#developeruser-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developer/User Experience" title="Direct link to Developer/User Experience">​</a></h3><p>Improving developer and user experience is crucial
for driving broader adoption.</p><ul><li>Generate libraries in various languages to
simplify blockchain interaction for developers.</li><li>Expand RPC capabilities to support queries
and transaction building, enabling seamless
integration with node services.</li><li>Empower developers to create custom chain
indexers for specific needs, such as supporting
partner chains. Creating a translation layer
of blocks and ledger events to a Nats Core
pub/sub messaging system can be used as an
example indexer framework.</li><li>Decentralize data API services to reduce
reliance on centralized providers and empower
SPOs.</li><li>Promote the use of local nodes and develop
standards for wallet interaction with full nodes.</li><li>Establish a unified standard for tracing,
logging, and monitoring across different
node implementations.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="programmable-assets">Programmable Assets<a href="#programmable-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Programmable Assets" title="Direct link to Programmable Assets">​</a></h3><p>Expanding the capabilities of programmable
assets will unlock new possibilities for
decentralized applications.</p><p>Enhancing Cardano&#x27;s programmable asset capabilities is crucial for
unlocking the full potential of dApps. They expand on-chain asset
functionality beyond simple transfers, enabling complex,
programmable logic. These advancements will empower developers to
build innovative dApps, exploring use cases like soul-bound tokens,
or tokens that can never be transacted to another wallet,
for decentralized identity, mechanisms for custodian regulated
stablecoins, and royalty mechanisms to support creators.</p><ul><li>Develop frameworks that enable a new class
of programmable assets beyond native tokens.</li><li>UTxO intent signatures enhance decentralized exchange
interactions by allowing users to signify their intent
to spend UTxOs under specific conditions, facilitating
swaps while maintaining user ownership of their funds.</li><li>Explore the use of soul-bound tokens for
decentralized identity and other applications.</li><li>Implement royalty mechanisms to support
creators and incentivize innovation.</li><li>Enable the issuance of custodian regulated stablecoins
on Cardano through policy-based mechanisms, such as USDC/USDT.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multiple-node-implementations">Multiple Node Implementations<a href="#multiple-node-implementations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple Node Implementations" title="Direct link to Multiple Node Implementations">​</a></h3><p>The development and maintenance of multiple node implementations are
absolutely crucial for Cardano&#x27;s resilience and censorship resistance;
however only if they adhere to a properly implemented and secure specification.
This diversity strengthens security through a form of distributed peer
review, as different teams scrutinize each codebase, increasing the
likelihood of identifying and addressing potential flaws before they
can be exploited. Furthermore, diverse implementations decentralize the
development process itself, reducing the risk associated with relying
on a single entity. This distributed development model fosters a more
robust and adaptable ecosystem, as different teams bring unique
perspectives and approaches to the ongoing evolution of the Cardano
network Ultimately, the more high-quality, independent node
implementations we have, the stronger, censorship resistant and more decentralized
Cardano becomes, ensuring its long-term viability and success.</p><p>Ensuring node conformity in Cardano relies heavily on rigorous formal
specifications. These specifications serve as the definitive
guide for node implementation, detailing the precise behavior and
functionality expected of every compliant node. They enable property tests to be
automatically extracted, enabling node implementations to demonstrate full
conformance to the specifications.  By adhering to these meticulously crafted
specifications, node developers can create implementations that are interoperable
and compatible with the broader Cardano network. By providing concrete, actionable
instructions and guidelines for building and configuring nodes, ensuring
consistency and adherence to the established standards. This combination of
precise specifications is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of
the Cardano network, guaranteeing that all participating nodes operate
according to the agreed-upon rules and protocols.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spo-incentive-improvements">SPO Incentive Improvements<a href="#spo-incentive-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SPO Incentive Improvements" title="Direct link to SPO Incentive Improvements">​</a></h3><p>The community has identified incentives can be improved for stake
pool operators. This is a few suggestions of what can be assessed.</p><ul><li>Introduce min-margin parameter that can be voted on via governance to modify</li><li>Modify pledge-benefit curve for a0</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> This vision and  roadmap represents a high-level overview
and will be further refined and iterated upon based
on ongoing research, community feedback, and
technological advancements. It is based on the results of the TSC survey.
The initial author of this roadmap is Sam Leathers, Chair for
the Intersect Product Committee.</p></article></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#vision" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Vision</a></li><li><a href="#roadmap" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Roadmap</a><ul><li><a href="#scaling-the-l1-engine" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Scaling the L1 Engine</a></li><li><a href="#incoming-liquidity" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Incoming Liquidity</a></li><li><a href="#l2-expansion" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">L2 Expansion</a></li><li><a href="#developeruser-experience" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Developer/User Experience</a></li><li><a href="#programmable-assets" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Programmable Assets</a></li><li><a href="#multiple-node-implementations" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Multiple Node Implementations</a></li><li><a href="#spo-incentive-improvements" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">SPO Incentive Improvements</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Intersect Product Committee.
